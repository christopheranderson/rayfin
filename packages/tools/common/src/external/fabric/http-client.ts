/**
 * Universal HTTP transport for the Microsoft Fabric REST API.
 *
 * Transport-agnostic: requests go through an injected {@link Http} adapter
 * whose host implementation owns authentication (the bearer token is attached
 * by the adapter, never here). Verbose detail is emitted through the optional
 * {@link Diagnostics} sink rather than written to the console, so the client
 * is safe to run in any host (CLI, VS Code desktop/web).
 *
 * This is the low-level transport (paths, verbs, status handling), not a
 * Fabric operation vocabulary. Steps and product services SHOULD depend on a
 * higher-level operations interface (e.g. `FabricClient` with
 * `getWorkspace()` / `resolveOrCreateItem()`), which can be backed by this
 * transport today and by the generated Fabric TypeScript SDK later without
 * changing its consumers. See the external-services notes in
 * docs/rfc/rayfin-tools-architecture.md.
