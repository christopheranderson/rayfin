 * Node hosts back this with the MSAL device-code / silent flow; the VS Code
 * host uses `vscode.authentication.getSession`; a service host could use a
 * managed identity. Scopes are provider-specific (e.g. a Fabric resource
 * scope). The parameter is an array because AAD issues tokens per scope-set
 * and both backing providers (`acquireToken*({ scopes })`,
 * `getSession(provider, scopes)`) take arrays; a single scope is `[scope]`.
 *
 * Acquisition mode is host-decided today (silent-then-interactive). When the
 * first non-interactive/CI path needs to say "fail instead of prompting", or
 * a caller needs to bypass a cached token, surface it as an additive,
 * non-breaking options arg — `getToken(scopes, { silent?, forceRefresh? })` —
 * shaped by the Phase 2 impl that first consumes it, rather than guessed now.
