/**
 * TelemetryHandle adapter — per-invocation event enrichment.

 * async-local-storage, which is unavailable in the VS Code web host.
 *
 * Properties are string dimensions; measurements are numeric metrics.
 * Callers MUST pass only safe, non-identifying values (the shared telemetry
 * policy gate and sanitizer remain the source of truth for what is emitted).
