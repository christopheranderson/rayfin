/**
 * Static-hosting product-service contract (Layer 3).
 *
 * Validates, builds, packages, and deploys the static frontend configured via
 * `services.staticHosting` in `rayfin.yml`, and persists the resulting hosting
 * URL. Workflows declare this in their `Deps` and compose its operations from
 * steps; the orchestration (validate → build → package → deploy → persist)
 * lives in the workflow, not here.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally fine-grained — each operation maps to one
 * existing capability so the host implementation
 * (`cli/src/rayfin-services/static-hosting.ts`) is a thin delegation. It is
 * Node-free: binary payloads are `Uint8Array` (not Node `Buffer`) so the
 * contract is satisfiable in any host.
