/**
 * Workload error vocabulary, translated to the fields a Builder edits.
 *
 * The workload still names `anonymousAccess` because that is its wire field,
 * but no Rayfin project has authored that key since the rename. Passing the
 * workload's own text through would send a Builder looking for a property that
 * `rayfin.yml` no longer has, so each known code is restated in terms of
 * `assetAccess`.
 *
 * Lives beside the outbound translation rather than in a host, so the CLI and
 * the VS Code extension cannot drift into describing the same rejection
 * differently.
