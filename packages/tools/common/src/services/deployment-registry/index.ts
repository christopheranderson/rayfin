/**
 * Deployment-registry product-service contract (Layer 3).
 *
 * Owns the multi-deployment registry (`rayfin/.deployments.json`) and the
 * `RAYFIN_PUBLIC_*` mirror into `rayfin/.env`: recording a deployment after
 * `rayfin up`, reading it back, listing deployments, and switching the active
 * one. It tracks deployment state; it does not perform deployments. Workflows
 * declare this in their `Deps` and never touch the filesystem or the registry
 * format directly.
 *
 * Phase 2 backs this with the CLI's existing deployment-registry and
 * deployment-env-file utils; the interface lives here so the `up` workflow
 * (and later other hosts) depend only on the universal contract. It is
 * intentionally Node-free, and every operation is async so a host whose
 * filesystem access is asynchronous (e.g. the VS Code web host backed by
 * `vscode.workspace.fs`) can satisfy it; the CLI host wraps its synchronous
 * utils.
 *
 * Out of scope here (by design): interactive deployment selection, which is a
 * Layer 1 prompt concern, and hydrating a deployment from Fabric, which is
 * deferred until the Fabric operations interface exists.
