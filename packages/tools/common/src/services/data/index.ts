/**
 * Data product-service contract (Layer 3).
 *
 * Generates the Data API Builder (DAB) configuration from a project's
 * TypeScript entity decorators and applies it to a DAB server — either the
 * local dev server or the deployed remote workload. Workflows declare this in
 * their `Deps` and never touch the filesystem, DAB endpoints, or output
 * rendering directly.
 *
 * Phase 2 backs this with the CLI's existing `applyDbConfig`; the interface
 * lives here so the `up` workflow (and later the VS Code host) depend only on
 * the universal contract. It is intentionally Node-free — the implementation
 * that performs filesystem and network IO lives in the host
 * (`cli/src/rayfin-services/data.ts`).
