/**
 * Auth product-service contract (Layer 3).
 *
 * Higher-level than the `Auth` adapter (raw token acquisition): an
 * `AuthService` ensures the user has an active Rayfin session for the
 * requested scopes — triggering an interactive login when none exists — and
 * returns the resulting token. Workflows declare this in their `Deps` and
 * never touch MSAL, secret stores, or login prompts directly.
 *
 * Phase 2 backs this with the CLI's existing `ensureAuthenticated`; the
 * interface lives here so the `up` workflow (and later the VS Code host)
 * depend only on the universal contract. The shape mirrors the CLI's
 * `TokenResult` so the first implementation is a thin delegation.
