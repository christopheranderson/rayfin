/**
 * Shared environment-configuration model for Rayfin tools.
 *
 * Five `RAYFIN_*` env vars constitute the user-supplied "environment
 * override" model. They split into two semantically distinct groups:
 *
 *   - **Authentication overrides** (`auth` group) — `RAYFIN_AUTHORITY_HOST`,
 *     `RAYFIN_CLIENT_ID`, `RAYFIN_FABRIC_SCOPE`. These re-target the
 *     MSAL sign-in itself and SHOULD NOT be used by end-users; they
 *     exist so contributors can point the CLI at an alternate Fabric
 *     environment with a different Entra app registration.
 *
 *   - **Endpoint overrides** (`endpoint` group) — `RAYFIN_FABRIC_API_URL`,
 *     `RAYFIN_FABRIC_PORTAL_URL`. Each variable is read by
 *     downstream code via `process.env` and can be set independently
 *     (in the shell or in `rayfin/.env`) for one-off invocations.
 *
 * Persistence to `~/.rayfin/auth.json` is gated on the **auth** group.
 * Setting any auth var triggers persistence and requires all five
 * variables to be set; setting only endpoint vars is allowed but is
 * NOT persisted (the user is using them as one-off process env values).
 *
 * Callers (today: `@microsoft/rayfin-cli` and `@microsoft/create-rayfin`)
 * read these vars at startup so a single `rayfin login` against an
 * alternate Fabric environment survives across subsequent CLI /
 * `create-rayfin` invocations.
 *
 * Both the env-var → persisted-field mapping ({@link RAYFIN_ENV_CONFIG_VARS})
 * and the persisted shape ({@link EnvironmentConfig}) live here in
 * `@microsoft/rayfin-tools-common` so that the CLI, `create-rayfin`,
 * and any future tools share a single source of truth and don't take
 * dependencies on each other's internals.
 *
 * The shared model itself is **universal** — it does not import Node.js
 * APIs and is safe to bundle into browser/WebWorker consumers (e.g. VS
 * Code webviews). The Node-only filesystem hydration helper
 * `bootstrapEnvironmentConfig` is also re-exported below for
 * convenience, but only Node-only consumers (CLI entry points) should
 * reference it. Browser/WebWorker consumers must import only the
 * universal symbols below.

 *   triggers persistence at login and requires every entry across
 *   both groups to be set.
 * - `endpoint` — endpoint override (`RAYFIN_FABRIC_API_URL`,
 *   `RAYFIN_FABRIC_PORTAL_URL`). When no auth var is set, endpoint
 *   vars can be set freely as one-off process env values but are not
 *   persisted by `rayfin login`.

 * `RAYFIN_FABRIC_API_URL`, `RAYFIN_FABRIC_PORTAL_URL`) once before
 * `rayfin login` survives across subsequent CLI invocations.
 *
 * The portal URL is included as a first-class knob (rather than relying
 * solely on derivation from the API host) because non-`*.fabric.microsoft.com`
 * Fabric hosts (for example, the `analysis-df.windows.net` family) have
 * no algorithmic relationship between their API host and the matching
 * portal host, and even within `*.fabric.microsoft.com` a single API
 * host (`api.fabric.microsoft.com`) maps to multiple legitimate portals
 * (`app`, `daily`, `dxt`). Persisting the portal URL avoids the
 * scaffolded project silently pointing at the production portal.
 *
 * All sub-fields are individually optional so the schema is forward-
 * compatible: future overrides can be added without invalidating older
 * persisted state, and an older CLI reading a newer file ignores any
 * unknown sub-fields.
